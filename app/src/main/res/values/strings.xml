    <string name="aboutRSAMI">In 1949, the need for a Central Sports and Games ground for Southern command was felt and General Maharaja Shri Rajendra Sinhji, D.S.O, GOC-in-C Southern Command, ordered the Polo Club ground to be leveled to accommodate a Cricket, Football and  Hockey ground……………..

….approached Poona club…… The Poona club, however, could not find their way to meet this request……….

……..It was then decided by the GOC-in-C to start in a small way………………..An open air dance was organized on 15th March 1950 to collect funds and at the same time mark the opening of the institute………….

………..A meeting of the officers of the Poona Garrison was held and the officers unanimously requested General Rajendra Sinhji to agree to the club being called ‘The Rajendra Sinhji Army Mess and Institute for Defense Services Officers’

Thus on 20th April 1950 the Rajendra Sinhji Army Mess and Institute officially came into being ……………
………….The motto approved for the Institute is ‘Comradeship through Sport’……………..</string>
